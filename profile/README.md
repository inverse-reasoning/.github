  Inverse reasoning, also referred to as retroductive reasoning, is a cognitive process 
  that involves inferring the underlying causes or factors responsible for observed 
  effects or outcomes. In essence, it entails working backwards from the result to uncover 
  the plausible reasons or circumstances that could have led to the observed consequence, 
  allowing for a deeper understanding of the causal relationships between events or phenomena.
